# Longest common subsequence

This is me messing around trying to learn [longest common
subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
and how to calculate diffs.

## Usage

This is both a library and an example. The example can be run like this:

```
$ cargo run --example diff a b
  H
- i
+ e
+ y
  !
```

This works almost exactly like the normal C `diff` utility.
